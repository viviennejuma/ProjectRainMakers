# Assesment
Find if raining today and raining tomorrow are correlated.
# Overview
Using the weaher dataset that has factors affecting rainfall to solve the research question. We will work as a Data Scientist for the Australia weather department to investigate a claim about rainfall.
In an effort to do this, we need to identify some areas and periods of interest from sampling stating the reason to the choice of method, then perform hypothesis testing with regards to the claim that we will have made.
To work on this project, we will perform the following analysis with Python;

Find and deal with outliers, anomalies, and missing data within the dataset.

Plot appropriate univariate and bivariate summaries recording our observations.

Implement the solution by performing hypothesis testing.

This will need to be documented when writing the report.

Below are the guidelines for creating your report:
# Problem Statement
Introduce the data you will be describing and the random variable that you are investigating. State very precisely the null and alternate hypothesis that you will be testing. Provide some explanation for why this hypothesis is important and/or interesting.
# Data Description
Provide information about the data necessary to understand the rest of the report including a precise statement of the random variable. Provide a description of the source of your data and the data collection procedures, the descriptive statistics, and some assertions about the model that is consistent with the data.
# Hypothesis Testing Procedure
Present the details concerning how you will test your hypothesis. Describe the logic behind your null and alternate hypotheses -- where did they come from, why are they interesting. Describe the test statistic will you use (i.e., z, t, f) and why?
# Hypothesis Testing Results
Start with the results of your test. State the value of the test statistics and the result of the accept/reject decision. Identify the p-value of the test.
# Summary and Conclusions
  Summarize the process of the project Provide the concluding statement concerning the hypothesis, the results, and the sensitivity of the testing. Dataset The dataset and glossary to use for this project can be found here [https://www.kaggle.com/jsphyg/weather-dataset-rattle-package]
